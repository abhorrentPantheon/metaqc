#summary About page for metaqc

= Introduction =

metaqc offers a method for tracking the performance of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) instruments by using a defined instrument Quality Control sample ([iQC_mix iQC mix]) to identify the change in peak area and intensity of compounds over time, and produce a report indicating those items which are diagnostic of instrument condition.


= Requirements =

  * *[http://code.google.com/p/pyms PyMS]* -- Peak identification, integration
  * *pdf2latex* -- Report creation
  * *sqlite3* -- Database management

_Note that PyMS has its own dependencies, and as such these are inherited by metaqc._

= How to use `metaqc` =

The first step to creating a local installation of this tool is to install [http://code.google.com/p/pyms PyMS] into the `/x/` folder on the machine. 

Once the PyMS installation has been validated, [http://code.google.com/p/metaqc/source/checkout checkout] this project into the same `/x/` folder, which will create the `metaqc` project folder.

Edit the [Configuration configuration file] for `metaqc`, most notably changing the [Configuration#General instrument paths] and [Configuration#Mail_settings mail settings] values.

At this point `metaqc` should be ready to run. You can either run it manually by issuing
{{{
python /x/metaqc/picker/proc.py 
}}}
or by setting up a cron job to run the same call on a regular basis.
