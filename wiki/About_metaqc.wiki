#summary About page for metaqc

= Introduction =

metaqc offers a method for tracking the performance of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) instruments by using a defined instrument Quality Control sample ([iQC_mix iQC mix]) to identify the change in peak area and intensity of compounds over time, and produce a report indicating those items which are diagnostic of instrument condition.


= Requirements =

  * *PyMS* -- Peak identification, integration
  * *pdf2latex* -- Report creation
  * *sqlite3* -- Database management

_Note that PyMS has its own dependencies, and as such these are inherited by metaqc._
