#How to configure the metaqc tool

= Introduction =

`metaqc` has a configuration file called `default.cfg`. This file has a number of entries which enable the user to set a number of options, including who receives the `metaqc` reports and where the QC files themselves are located.

The entries in the file are specified as `name = value`. Multiple values can be specified by leaving blank space at the beginning of the next line, i.e.
{{{
name =
    value1
    value2
}}}
This is particularly useful for the instrument paths, and will allow multiple instruments to be monitored by the `metaqc` tool.
